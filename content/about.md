## Hey, I'm the brain behind FocusHacked 🧠

I have ADHD. Diagnosed as an adult. Spent years trying every planner, app, and "productivity system" out there — most of them designed by neurotypical people who think "just write a to-do list" is helpful advice.

Spoiler: it's not.

**FocusHacked exists because I got tired of generic "best productivity apps" lists** that don't account for how ADHD brains actually work. We don't need more apps — we need the *right* apps. The ones that work with our brains instead of against them.

### What you'll find here

- **Honest reviews** of apps, planners, and tools — tested with an actual ADHD brain
- **Head-to-head comparisons** (because choosing between 47 apps is its own executive function nightmare)
- **Practical guides** that skip the fluff and get to "here's what to do"

### What you won't find

- Sponsored posts pretending to be reviews
- "Top 50 productivity apps" listicles with zero depth
- Advice from people who've never experienced time blindness

### How this site makes money

Transparency matters. Some links on this site are affiliate links — if you buy something through them, I earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. I only recommend things I've actually tested and would use myself.

No sponsored content. No pay-to-play reviews. Ever.
