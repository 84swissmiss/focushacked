## The short version

I'm a 41-year-old founder, investor, and mom of two. I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, which explained... a lot. About 30 years of "why can't you just focus?" suddenly made sense.

I've built companies, sat on boards, raised funding, and managed a portfolio of startups. I've also forgotten to eat lunch, missed flights because "five more minutes" turned into two hours, and once reorganized my entire kitchen instead of finishing a pitch deck that was due the next morning.

ADHD is fun like that.

## Why this site exists

I've tried every productivity system out there. Bullet journals, GTD, time blocking, Pomodoro, that one app someone on Reddit swore would change my life. Most of them were built for neurotypical brains. They work great if you already have the executive function to maintain a system. But if you had that, you wouldn't need the system in the first place.

**FocusHack is the site I wish existed when I got diagnosed.** Real reviews from someone who gets it. Not a therapist explaining what ADHD is. Not a tech blogger who tried an app for a week. Someone who actually lives with this brain, every day, while juggling kids and work and the constant low-level chaos of adult ADHD.

## What I test and how

Every tool on this site gets used for at least two weeks in my actual life. Not in a lab. Not in ideal conditions. In the middle of school pickups, investor calls, and the kind of days where you open your laptop and genuinely cannot remember what you were about to do.

I look at:

- **Setup friction**: If it takes 45 minutes to configure, I've already lost interest
- **ADHD-specific features**: Does it actually help with time blindness, task initiation, or overwhelm?
- **Stick factor**: Am I still using it after week two, or did it join the app graveyard?
- **Price vs. value**: Because ADHD tax is real enough without overpaying for apps

## How this site makes money

Some links on this site are affiliate links. If you buy something through them, I earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. That's it. No sponsored posts, no pay-to-play reviews. I only recommend things I've actually used and would tell a friend about.
