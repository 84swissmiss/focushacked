I've tried both. Multiple times. With the enthusiasm of someone who just discovered a new system that's *definitely* going to fix everything. Spoiler: neither one fixed everything. But one of them stuck, and the other kept becoming a beautiful graveyard of abandoned dashboards.

Here's the todoist vs notion adhd showdown you actually need.

## The Quick Verdict

**If you need to get things done today, pick Todoist. If you need to build a second brain and have the hyperfocus hours to set it up, pick Notion.**

Todoist is the tool that respects your executive function limitations. Notion is the tool that rewards your hyperfocus sessions. Both are genuinely good. But they solve different problems, and your ADHD brain cares a lot about which problem is louder right now.

| | Todoist | Notion |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup time** | 5 minutes | 5 hours (minimum) |
| **Task management** | ★★★★★ | ★★★☆☆ |
| **Reminders** | ★★★★★ | ★★☆☆☆ |
| **Mobile app** | ★★★★★ | ★★★☆☆ |
| **Customization** | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★★★ |
| **ADHD-friendliness** | ★★★★☆ | ★★★☆☆ |
| **Free plan** | Solid | Very generous |

## Setup Friction: The Make-or-Break for ADHD Brains

This is where most productivity advice falls apart for us. Someone recommends a tool. We download it. We open it. And then we see a blank page that requires 47 decisions before we can write down "buy milk."

**Todoist wins this round so hard it's almost unfair.** You open it. You type a task. You press enter. Done. The natural language input understands "call dentist tomorrow at 2pm" and just... handles it. No databases to configure. No templates to hunt for. No properties to define.

Notion requires you to decide: Page or database? Table or board or list or timeline? What properties do you need? Do you want a formula for due dates? Should you add a relation to your projects database?

If you have ADHD, you know what happens next. You spend three hours building a gorgeous task system. You feel productive. You haven't completed a single actual task. Two weeks later you've abandoned it because the friction of logging a simple to-do is four clicks too many.

That said. If you catch a hyperfocus wave and build something that clicks? Notion can be incredible. The problem is the gap between "I downloaded this" and "this is useful" is a canyon.

## Task Management Through the ADHD Lens

Todoist does one thing and does it well: tasks. You have projects. You have due dates. You have priorities (1 through 4, color coded, dead simple). You have labels if you want them. That's basically it.

For ADHD brains, this constraint is a feature. Fewer decisions means less task paralysis. You open the app, you see what's due today, you pick something. The "today" view is genuinely one of the best things about Todoist because it eliminates the "but what should I work on" spiral.

Notion gives you a blank canvas. You *can* build an incredible task management system with filtered views and status fields and Kanban boards and recurring templates. People on Reddit have built absolute masterpieces. But you have to build it first. And then you have to maintain it. And then you have to actually use it instead of just tweaking it.

**The honest truth:** I've never met someone with ADHD who built a Notion task system and stuck with it for more than three months without doing a complete rebuild. I've met plenty who've used Todoist for years.

## Reminders and Notifications

This is critical for time blindness. If your tool can't yell at you, it's a pretty notebook. Not a productivity system.

**Todoist has best-in-class reminders.** Location-based reminders (ping me when I'm near Target). Time-based reminders. Persistent notifications that don't disappear after you swipe once. You can set multiple reminders per task. The reminder system alone is worth using Todoist.

Notion's reminders are... there. Technically. You can set a reminder on a database item and it'll send a notification. But it feels like an afterthought. No location reminders. No persistent notifications. If you miss the ping, it's gone. For someone with ADHD, a reminder system that's easy to miss is barely a reminder system at all.

## Mobile Experience

You're standing in the grocery store. You just remembered you need to reschedule that meeting. You have maybe 11 seconds of motivation before your brain moves on.

**Todoist's mobile app is fast.** Like, actually fast. You can add a task from the widget without even opening the app. Quick add with natural language works beautifully on mobile. The app loads instantly. This matters so much more than people think.

Notion's mobile app has improved a lot, but it's still slow. Loading a page takes a few seconds. Finding the right database takes a few more. By the time you've navigated to your task list, that 11-second motivation window has closed and you're scrolling Instagram instead.

I'm not exaggerating. Speed is accessibility for ADHD. If it takes more than two taps to capture a thought, that thought is gone.

## Template Ecosystem

Here's where Notion starts to fight back.

Notion's template ecosystem is massive. There are hundreds of ADHD-specific templates: habit trackers, brain dumps, dopamine menus, energy level trackers, project dashboards with built-in body doubling timers. The community has built genuinely useful stuff.

Todoist has templates too, but they're basically pre-made project lists. Useful but not exciting. A "moving checklist" or "marketing campaign" template. Functional. Not the kind of thing you'd hyperfocus on for a Saturday afternoon.

The double-edged sword: Notion templates can become another form of procrastination. Downloading and customizing templates *feels* productive. It scratches the novelty-seeking itch. But if you're spending more time setting up your system than using it, the tool is working against you.

## Price Comparison

| Plan | Todoist | Notion |
|---|---|---|
| **Free** | Up to 5 projects, 5 collaborators | Unlimited pages, limited blocks for teams |
| **Mid tier** | $5/month (Pro) | $10/month (Plus) |
| **Top tier** | $8/month (Business) | $18/month (Business) |

**Todoist's free plan** is limiting but usable. Five projects forces you to keep things simple, which honestly might be a good thing. The Pro plan at $5/month is reasonable and unlocks reminders, which are essential.

**Notion's free plan** is wildly generous for personal use. You get unlimited pages and blocks. You can build your entire life operating system without paying a cent. The paid plans mostly matter for collaboration features and file uploads.

For solo ADHD use, Notion's free plan gives you more. But Todoist Pro at $5/month gives you the reminders that make the whole thing work.

## Pick Todoist If...

- You need something that works in five minutes, not five hours
- Reminders are non-negotiable (they should be)
- You've abandoned complex systems before (be honest)
- You want to capture tasks quickly from your phone
- You value "done" over "organized"
- Task paralysis is your main enemy
- You just want a damn to-do list that works

## Pick Notion If...

- You need a knowledge base alongside your tasks (recipes, SOPs, project notes)
- You enjoy the setup process and it genuinely helps you think
- You want everything in one app: notes, tasks, wiki, databases
- You have the patience (or hyperfocus capacity) to build and maintain a system
- Your work requires heavy documentation
- You want something that grows with you and adapts to exactly how your brain works

## Pick Both If...

This is actually what I do. And I know "use both" sounds like a cop-out, but hear me out.

**Todoist for tasks. Notion for knowledge.**

Every actionable item goes in Todoist. Every reference document, project plan, and brain dump goes in Notion. Todoist tells me what to do today. Notion tells me how to do it and why I decided to do it in the first place (because I will absolutely forget).

The rule is simple: if it has a due date or needs to get done, Todoist. If it needs to be remembered or referenced, Notion. No overlap. No syncing nightmares. Two tools, two jobs.

## FAQ

### Is Todoist or Notion better for ADHD?

Todoist is better for pure task management with ADHD. It's faster, simpler, and has better reminders. Notion is better if you need a full workspace and have the executive function bandwidth to set it up.

### Can Notion replace Todoist for task management?

Technically yes. Practically, for ADHD brains, usually no. Notion's task management requires too much setup and maintenance. The friction adds up.

### Is Todoist good for ADHD?

Yes. It's one of the better task apps for ADHD because of its simple interface, natural language input, and strong reminder system. The "today" view reduces decision fatigue.

### What's the biggest ADHD trap with Notion?

Spending all your productive hours building the system instead of using it. The customization is addictive, and for novelty-seeking ADHD brains, tweaking your setup feels like working. It's not.

### Can I use Todoist and Notion together?

Absolutely. Use Todoist for actionable tasks with deadlines and Notion for notes, documentation, and reference material. Keep the boundary clear: if it needs doing, it goes in Todoist. If it needs remembering, it goes in Notion.

### Is the free version of Todoist enough for ADHD management?

The free plan works but has limits. The Pro plan ($5/month) unlocks reminders and more projects. If you're serious about using Todoist for ADHD management, the Pro plan is worth it for reminders alone.
