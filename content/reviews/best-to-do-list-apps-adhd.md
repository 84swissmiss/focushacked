I've abandoned more to-do list apps than most people have ever downloaded. Forty-three, at last count. That's not a flex. That's ADHD.

Here's what I've learned after years of trying every shiny new productivity app, only to forget it exists three days later: most to-do list apps are built for neurotypical brains. They assume you can look at a list of 47 tasks and just... pick one. They assume you know how long things take. They assume you won't spend 90 minutes organizing your task system instead of doing a single task on it.

So I went looking for the **best to do list app for ADHD**. Not the best app for productivity influencers. Not the best app for people who already have their shit together. The best app for brains like mine that freeze in front of a long list, lose track of time like it's a set of car keys, and occasionally hyperfocus on reorganizing task categories for four hours.

These six made the cut.

## 1. Todoist

[Todoist](https://todoist.com) is the Honda Civic of to-do apps. It's not flashy. It's reliable. It starts every single time.

The reason it works for ADHD is the natural language input. Type "call dentist tomorrow at 2pm" and it just creates the task with the right date and time. No clicking through menus. No date pickers. You dump the thought and move on before your brain has time to get distracted by something else.

The project and label system is flexible enough to build whatever organization structure works for you. But here's the real talk: don't. Don't spend a weekend building an elaborate project hierarchy. Start with one project. Add more only when you actually need them.

**ADHD Pros:**
- Quick capture is genuinely quick. Keyboard shortcut, type, done.
- Recurring tasks are easy to set up (great for stuff you always forget, like taking bins out).
- Karma system gives you little dopamine hits for completing tasks.

**ADHD Cons:**
- The free version limits you to 5 projects. That can feel restrictive.
- No built-in time tracking or Pomodoro timer.
- It's easy to over-organize and spend all your time on the system instead of the tasks.

**Pricing:** Free tier available. Pro is $5/month or $48/year. Business is $8/user/month.

**Skip if...** you need heavy time-blocking or calendar integration without paying. The free tier is solid but limited.

## 2. Things 3

[Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) is the app I open when every other app feels like too much. And that happens a lot.

It's Apple only, which is a dealbreaker for some. But if you're in the Apple ecosystem, nothing else feels this calm. The design is minimal without being empty. There's a "Today" view, an "Upcoming" view, and an "Anytime" bucket. That's basically it.

For ADHD brains drowning in decision fatigue, that simplicity is the whole point. You're not staring at a screen wondering which of 14 views to use. You check Today. You do the things. (Theoretically.)

**ADHD Pros:**
- Gorgeous, distraction-free interface. Your brain can actually rest here.
- Headings within projects let you break big tasks into chunks without needing sub-projects.
- Quick entry from anywhere on Mac with a keyboard shortcut.

**ADHD Cons:**
- No collaboration features. This is solo only.
- One-time purchase but you're buying it three times (Mac, iPhone, iPad). It adds up.
- No web version. Forget your phone at home and you're toast.

**Pricing:** $49.99 (Mac), $15.99 (iPad), $9.99 (iPhone). One-time purchases. No subscription.

**Skip if...** you use Android or Windows at all, or you need to share lists with anyone.

## 3. TickTick

[TickTick](https://ticktick.com) is the Swiss Army knife on this list. It does tasks, habits, Pomodoro timers, calendar views, and a bunch of other stuff. Normally that much feature bloat would make me nervous. But TickTick pulls it off without feeling overwhelming.

The built-in Pomodoro timer is the reason it's here. If you're ADHD and you haven't tried Pomodoro yet, it's the "work for 25 minutes, break for 5" technique. It's one of the few things that actually helps with time blindness because the timer externalizes the concept of time for you. Having it right there in your task app, instead of needing a separate timer, removes one more friction point.

**ADHD Pros:**
- Pomodoro timer built right into the task view. Start a task, start a timer. Beautiful.
- Habit tracker included. Good for building those routines ADHD brains desperately need.
- Calendar view lets you see your tasks on a timeline, which helps with time blindness.

**ADHD Cons:**
- So many features that you might spend days exploring instead of doing anything.
- The free version is surprisingly generous but some ADHD-useful features (calendar view) are premium.
- Interface isn't as clean as Things 3 or Todoist.

**Pricing:** Free tier is solid. Premium is $35.99/year.

**Skip if...** you get overwhelmed by feature-rich apps. If the words "habit tracker, Pomodoro, calendar view, and Eisenhower matrix" in one app make you feel tired, this isn't for you.

## 4. Lunatask

[Lunatask](https://lunatask.app) is the only app on this list that seems to understand that productivity isn't just about tasks. It's about your brain. Your energy. Your mood. The fact that some days you can conquer the world and other days opening your laptop feels like climbing Everest.

It lets you log your mood and energy levels alongside your tasks. Then it actually uses that data to help you plan. Low energy day? It'll suggest lighter tasks. That's not a gimmick. For ADHD brains that fluctuate wildly between "I can do anything" and "I can do nothing," this is incredibly useful.

It also has built-in privacy features. Everything is encrypted. No account required. For the ADHD folks who also deal with anxiety (so... most of us), knowing your mood data isn't sitting on some company's server matters.

**ADHD Pros:**
- Mood and energy tracking integrated into task planning. Finally, an app that gets it.
- Focus mode hides everything except what you're working on right now.
- No account creation required. Less friction to start.

**ADHD Cons:**
- Desktop and web only. No mobile app yet. That's rough.
- Smaller company, smaller community. Fewer integrations.
- The interface takes some getting used to. Not as intuitive as Todoist or Things 3.

**Pricing:** Free tier available. Premium is $6/month.

**Skip if...** you absolutely need a mobile app. Capturing tasks on your phone when they pop into your head is a huge part of ADHD management, and Lunatask can't do that yet.

## 5. Goblin Tools Magic To-Do

[Goblin Tools Magic To-Do](https://goblin.tools) is not really a to-do list app. It's a task breakdown tool. And it might be the most ADHD-specific thing on this list.

You know that feeling when your to-do list says "clean the house" and your brain just... shuts down? Task paralysis. The task is too big, too vague, and your brain refuses to figure out where to start. Goblin Tools fixes that. You type "clean the house" and it uses AI to break it into smaller steps. Pick up clothes from the floor. Load the dishwasher. Wipe kitchen counters. Suddenly it's doable.

You can adjust the "spiciness" slider to control how granular the breakdown gets. Need it broken into tiny steps because today is a bad brain day? Crank it up. Feeling pretty functional? Keep it low.

**ADHD Pros:**
- Destroys task paralysis. This is its entire reason for existing and it's brilliant at it.
- Free. Completely free. No catch.
- The spiciness slider is genius. Bad brain days get more steps. Good brain days get fewer.

**ADHD Cons:**
- It's not a full task manager. You'll need to pair it with another app.
- AI breakdowns aren't always perfect. Sometimes the suggestions are weird.
- No recurring tasks, no reminders, no calendar. It does one thing.

**Pricing:** Free.

**Skip if...** you need an actual task management system. This is a supplement, not a replacement. Use it alongside one of the other apps on this list.

## 6. Microsoft To Do

[Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com) is the sleeper pick. Nobody's excited about it. Nobody's making YouTube videos about their Microsoft To Do setup. And that's exactly why it works.

The "My Day" feature is the star here. Every morning, you get a clean slate. You pick what you're doing today from your existing lists. That's it. You're not looking at every task you've ever created. You're looking at today. For ADHD brains that get paralyzed by looking at 200 tasks across 15 lists, this daily reset is a lifesaver.

It also integrates with Outlook and the Microsoft ecosystem. If your work runs on Microsoft, this is the obvious choice. And it's completely free. Not "free with a premium tier." Just free.

**ADHD Pros:**
- My Day forces you to plan daily. The empty list each morning is oddly motivating.
- Completely free with no feature gates. Everything is available to everyone.
- Integration with Microsoft ecosystem means fewer apps to manage.

**ADHD Cons:**
- The design is bland. It works, but it won't spark joy.
- Smart lists are useful but not as powerful as Todoist's filters.
- "Suggested for today" recommendations can be hit or miss.

**Pricing:** Free. Actually free.

**Skip if...** you hate Microsoft's design language. It's functional, not beautiful. If aesthetics matter to your ADHD brain (and for many of us they do), Things 3 or Todoist will feel much better.

## So Which One Should You Pick?

I'm not going to tell you there's one best to do list app for ADHD. There isn't. But I'll give you the shortcut:

- **Paralyzed by big tasks?** Start with [Goblin Tools](https://goblin.tools) to break them down, then put them in whatever app you want.
- **Want something simple that just works?** [Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com). It's free and My Day is perfect for ADHD.
- **Apple user who needs calm?** [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/). Nothing else feels this peaceful.
- **Need timers built in?** [TickTick](https://ticktick.com). That Pomodoro integration is legit.
- **Want the most flexible option?** [Todoist](https://todoist.com). It grows with you.
- **Mood affects your productivity?** [Lunatask](https://lunatask.app). It actually accounts for that.

The real secret? The best app is the one you'll actually open tomorrow. Don't overthink it. Pick one. Try it for two weeks. If it sticks, great. If not, try the next one. That's not failure. That's just how ADHD brains find what works.

## FAQ

### What makes a to-do list app good for ADHD?

Low friction to add tasks, limited visual clutter, and some way to narrow focus to what matters right now. Apps that dump every task on one screen are ADHD kryptonite. You want something that helps you see less, not more.

### Can a to-do list app really help with ADHD?

It's one tool in the toolbox, not a cure. A good app reduces the cognitive load of remembering things and deciding what to do next. That's huge when your working memory is basically a goldfish. But it won't fix time blindness or task paralysis on its own.

### Is it worth paying for a to-do list app?

Depends on the app. Microsoft To Do and Goblin Tools are free and genuinely good. But if Todoist Pro or TickTick Premium has a feature that keeps you using the app, that $3-6/month is cheaper than any ADHD coach. Pay for what keeps you consistent.

### What about Notion or Obsidian for ADHD task management?

I love both for other things. But for to-do lists? No. They're too flexible. You'll spend three weeks building a custom task system and never actually use it. I speak from very expensive experience. Stick with a purpose-built task app.

### Should I use my to-do list app for everything or just work?

One app for everything. ADHD brains don't have separate "work memory" and "personal memory." You have one chaotic pile. Keeping tasks in multiple apps means things fall through the cracks. The cracks are where the doom pile lives.

### How do I stop abandoning to-do list apps after a week?

Start with fewer features, not more. Only use the basic task entry and a simple daily view for the first two weeks. Don't customize. Don't organize. Don't set up elaborate projects. Just capture tasks and check them off. Build the habit of opening the app before you build the system inside it.
